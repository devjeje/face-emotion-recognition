# face-emotion-recognition
This project implements a **Real-Time Facial Emotion Recognition System** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** built with TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV.   The model is trained on facial images categorized into seven emotion classes:   `angry`, `disgust`, `fear`, `happy`, `sad`, `surprise`, and `neutral`.
